<h2> Our Problem Statement </h2>
<p id="description">
 Our idea is based on the problem statement of ‚Äúcommuting smarter with reduced carbon footprint and better user experience‚Äù. We are focussing on enriching travel experiences and reducing carbon emissions released from road transportation by gamifying the journey of daily commuters. Our app wants to motivate people who tend to use personal conveyance to switch to public means of transport. Just Imagine the time, energy, money, and lives we can save just by diverting people to public transport. Our app will also achieve sustainable development goals.
Sdg13, SDG 3, and SDG 11

<h2> How we came up with this </h2>
<p id="description">
We came up with this because in Delhi, traffic congestion was a huge issue and because of the air pollution due to that we weren't able to commute outside especially in Nov. So why not solve this issue with the help of twist that is by making a game and diverting the traffic towards greener commute.
To solve this grave issue we ve introduced Fitcom which stands for Fit Indigenous Travel community.

It's a  web app that keeps you enthralled while you commute by gamifying your journey.
